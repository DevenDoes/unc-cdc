            Frequently Asked Questions
          </h2>
          <h3 class="sub-title">
            What should I expect to do at the Data Challenge?
          </h3>
          <p class="text text-sub-title">
            While the primary purpose of a datathon is for participants to create cool things from datasets, we hope that you’ll also take advantage of the networking opportunities, workshops, and fun events that’ll be happening!
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">
            I have no data science experience, so should I still attend?
          </h3>
          <p class="text text-sub-title">
            Absolutely! We don’t expect participants to have any experience when you show up so, in addition to some workshops that’ll help you build your skill set, we’ve got mentors to help you out along the way. You can check out the list of recommended software and tutorials under the references section if you want to skip the install time when hacking’s actually started.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-sub-title">
            We’ll be hosting a week of workshops Monday September 28th through October 1st to help you get the skills and experience you need to be successful at the data challenge.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">
            How do I find a team?
          </h3>
          <p class="text text-sub-title">
            You’re welcome to come with teammates, but if you don’t have any yet, there will be a team matching event the day before the event, October 2nd, where you can find your perfect teammates.

            What can I win?
